My name is Integra and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on January 28, 2020.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other dogs as long as they are not crazy and bouncing ones. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>My personality color is GREEN. I am an adaptable dog who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/><p/><p/>",GREEN
