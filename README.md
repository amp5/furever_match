## Data Sources

[Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/)

[Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Business Value

### For Adopters:
Creating a tool that provides more information for adopters to find cats that will suit their lifestyle.

### For Shelters:
Adding additional information seemlessly about adoptable cats which provides more bandwidth for the shelter to have more face time with potential adopters.


## MVP
Combine Petfinder data with weather data and breed information. Setup and run batch processing every 6 hours via Airflow. Create a dashboard for users to see new and improved cat profiles. 

## Stretch Goals
Combine this project to allow for cataloging a data lake for exploration.
